# Kurt Preston Dot Files

Provides an organized, version controlled, portable system configuration for *nix systems (including MacOS).  Notably, in includes shell customizations and aliases, custom VI commands and plugins, and the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) project.

## Installation

```
  git clone git://github.com/KurtPreston/dotfiles
  cd dotfiles
  rake install
```

**Note:** if you already have some commands in .bashrc or .bash_profile you would like to keep, just place them in the file **~/.localrc**.

## Theme and Plugin Selection
To set a theme, set the name to the ZSH_THEME environment variable in the ~/.localrc file.  For example, add the following line:

```
    ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

The Dot Files enable many plugins by default, but to enable additional oh-my-zsh plugins, list them in the plugins environment variable in ~/.localrc.  For example:

```
    plugins=(django osx)
```

## Bash Aliases

### General

```
  autoformat [filename]
    Removes whitespace and standardizes spacing
    ex: autoformat *.rb

  autoformatall
    Will autoformat all compatible files within a directory

  replace [files] [find text] [replace text]
    Performs a find/replace across multiple files
    ex: replace "*.erb" "<b>" "<strong>"

  reload

        (This is default MacOS behavior, but dotfiles enables it on Linux)

  h [file in the home directory]
    Jump to a folder in the home directory with tab completion
    ex: h Mu[tab] -> h Music

  c [file in the $CODE_HOME directory (~/code by default)]
    Jump to a folder in the $CODE_HOME directory with tab completion
    ex: c do[tab] -> c dotfiles
```

  gco -or- git co
    git checkout

  gs -or- git st
    git status

  gb -or- git br
    git branch

  git rb [remote branch name]
    checkout and track a remote branch

  git lg

  git pup

  git su

```

### Rails

  tlog

  rs
    rails server

  rc
    rails console

  rg
    rails generate

  rst
    restart server (touch tmp/restart.txt)
```

## VI Aliases

Note: many of the VI commands will require the installation of **gvim** on Linux machines, or **mvim** on MacOS machines.

```

      Autocomplete is enabled via the YouCompleteMe plugin

  \ff
    Open CtrlP, an excellent way to quickly open files

  \nt

          param1,
          param2,
          param3)

  :A
    Switch between test files and implementation file

  ctrl+p

  ctrl+x, ctrl-c, ctrl-v
    Cut, copy, and paste now work in Linux VI

## Credits

This project is a fork of Ryan Bates' dotfiles, integrates oh-my-zsh, and borrows significantly from Drew Olson's vim_dotfiles, in addition to dozens of other sources.
